      <p>Steak Story is a restaurant where you will be served excellent meat and fish, cooked in the best traditions of
        world cuisine, and the staff will also recommend a fine wine â€“ a combination that is attractive to people of
        all
        ages and walks of life. The steaks, roast beef, and carpaccio are of extremely good quality and made on the
        basis
        of secret recipes that were created decades ago. The most interesting part is the cooking of meat on natural
        coals
        in front of the guests, in the open kitchen.</p>
